# üìò **Phase 7 ‚Äì Release Management & Go-Live Plan**

This phase defines **how you will move code from development to production safely and repeatably**.

We‚Äôll keep it **structured, realistic, and cloud-ready**, so you can execute with confidence.

------

## üü¢ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Objectives

- Ensure **safe, predictable deployments**.
- Support **rollback in case of failures**.
- Provide **environment parity** across DEV, QA, and PROD.
- Define **release processes and responsibilities**.
- Validate readiness before go-live.

------

## üü¢ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Environments Overview

| Environment | Purpose             | Characteristics                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **DEV**     | Developer sandbox   | Docker Compose on local machines, frequent rebuilds  |
| **QA**      | Integration testing | Kubernetes cluster (Minikube or shared AWS EKS)      |
| **PROD**    | Production          | AWS EKS, RDS, managed Solr, full observability stack |



------

## üü¢ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Strategy

‚úÖ **Kubernetes Blue/Green Deployment**

**Why?**

- Minimal downtime.
- Easy rollback.
- Clear separation between active and candidate versions.

------

‚úÖ **How it works:**

| Step  | Action                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | New version is built and pushed to ECR.                      |
| **2** | Helm upgrade deploys the candidate version into a separate namespace or with separate labels (`color=green`). |
| **3** | Smoke tests and health checks run automatically.             |
| **4** | If tests pass, ingress traffic switches from blue to green pods. |
| **5** | Previous version (blue) kept warm for quick rollback.        |



------

## üü¢ 4Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Pipeline Flow (GitHub Actions)

‚úÖ **Pipeline Stages:**

| Stage                 | Action                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build**             | Compile code, run unit tests.                     |
| **Docker Build**      | Build and tag Docker images for all services.     |
| **Push**              | Push images to Amazon ECR.                        |
| **Deploy QA**         | Helm upgrade into QA namespace.                   |
| **Integration Tests** | Run end-to-end tests against QA.                  |
| **Approval**          | Manual sign-off for production promotion.         |
| **Deploy PROD**       | Helm upgrade into PROD namespace (blue/green).    |
| **Verification**      | Health checks, smoke tests.                       |
| **Notify**            | Slack/email notifications of success or rollback. |



‚úÖ **Security:**

- Use GitHub OIDC to get short-lived AWS credentials.
- No long-lived AWS keys in repos.

------

## üü¢ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Release Checklist

‚úÖ **Pre-Release Checks:**

- All unit and integration tests passing.
- Database migrations reviewed and tested.
- Configurations validated.
- Secrets and credentials in place.
- Observability (logs/metrics/traces) active.

‚úÖ **Release Day Activities:**

- Verify backups (DB snapshots).
- Notify stakeholders of deployment window.
- Execute blue/green deployment.
- Monitor dashboards in real time.
- Keep previous version warm for immediate rollback.

‚úÖ **Post-Deployment:**

- Verify key user journeys (checkout, search, login).
- Confirm no error spikes.
- Announce release complete.

------

## üü¢ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Rollback Plan

‚úÖ **If a release fails:**

- Roll traffic back to the previous (blue) version instantly.

- Use Helm rollback:

  ```
  php-template
  
  
  CopyEdit
  helm rollback <release> <revision>
  ```

- Keep the failed version tagged for analysis.

- Open incident record and root cause analysis.

------

## üü¢ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Production Readiness Review

‚úÖ **Go-live readiness criteria:**

| Area                   | Must Have                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Testing** | All critical workflows validated        |
| **Load Testing**       | Sustained load at 2x expected peak      |
| **Security Review**    | OAuth2 flows validated, secrets rotated |
| **Observability**      | Metrics and alerts active               |
| **Disaster Recovery**  | Backups tested                          |
| **Documentation**      | Runbooks, escalation procedures         |
| **Team Training**      | Dev and Ops trained on troubleshooting  |



------

## üü¢ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Release Calendar

‚úÖ **Cadence:**

- Minor releases: every 2‚Äì4 weeks.
- Hotfixes: as needed.
- Major upgrades: quarterly (if required).
