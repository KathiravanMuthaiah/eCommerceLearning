## üü¢ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interaction Flows

**Example Flow: Customer Places Order**

1. Customer browses catalog via API Gateway ‚Üí Catalog Service.
2. Adds items to cart via Cart Service.
3. Pricing Service computes final price.
4. Customer Service identifies profile/address.
5. Order Service creates order, reserves inventory.
6. Inventory Service decrements stock.
7. Notification Service sends confirmation email.
8. Reporting Service logs transaction for admin reporting.

------

## üü¢ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Security Overview

**Authentication/Authorization:**

- All external calls pass through API Gateway.
- JWT tokens (OAuth2) validate user sessions.
- Role-based access (admin vs. customer) enforced in API Gateway and services.

**Service-to-Service Security:**

- mTLS between microservices in Kubernetes.
- Internal services authenticated with service accounts.

**Secrets Management:**

- Kubernetes Secrets for DB credentials, API keys.

------

## üü¢ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Topology

**Development:**

- Docker Compose for all services.
- Local PostgreSQL, Solr, Redis, Kafka.

**QA/Production:**

- Kubernetes (AWS EKS).
- Helm charts per service.
- RDS PostgreSQL.
- Solr managed cluster.
- AWS SNS/SES for notifications.

------

## üü¢ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Observability

**Logging:**

- Each microservice logs to stdout ‚Üí Fluent Bit ‚Üí Elasticsearch.

**Metrics:**

- Prometheus scrapes metrics endpoints.
- Grafana dashboards.

**Tracing:**

- OpenTelemetry + Jaeger for distributed traces.

------

## üü¢ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Key Design Considerations

- **Extensibility:** Microservices allow adding future modules (payments, ERP integrations).
- **Scalability:** Services can scale independently.
- **Simplicity:** For initial phase, disable unused services (e.g., B2B, complex workflows).
- **Alignment:** Development and production environments are as similar as possible.

------

## üü¢ 11Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation

This approach ensures:

- **80% of functionality off the shelf**.
- Your team focuses **only on integrations, reporting, and operational excellence**.
- No duplicated efforts.



# üü¢ Storefront UI Decision

**Decision:**
 üëâ We will **use Broadleaf‚Äôs freely available Storefront UI (React reference implementation)**.

**Implication:**
 ‚úÖ No need to develop a custom storefront frontend for this phase.
 ‚úÖ We will only **configure, style, and possibly do minor adjustments**.
 ‚úÖ Focus remains on:

- Reporting API and admin reporting UI.
- Notification service integration.
- Infrastructure and deployment.
