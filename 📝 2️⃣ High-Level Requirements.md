### üü£ 2.3 Integration Requirements

1. **Payment Gateways** ( Moving to next version of development, now focus only on ecommerce off the shelf, ERP off the shelf, reporting development, integration development)
   - Support for at least 1 major gateway preferred MTN MoMo.
2. **Carrier APIs**   ( Moving to next version of development, now focus only on ecommerce off the shelf, ERP off the shelf, reporting development, integration development)
   - For delivery tracking
3. **ERP/CRM** (we need to choose the ERP and CRM which is very minimal for our ecommerce and opensource)
   - Sync stock and customer data
4. **Notification Providers** ( Use AWS (SES/SNS) and Firebase for notifications)
   - SMS
   - Email
   - Push notifications

------

### üîµ 2.4 Deployment & Operations

1. **Containerization**
   - All custom Java services in Docker

4. **Environment Strategy**
   - DEV, QA,  PROD ( removed Staging directly to PROD from QA)
   - Blue/Green or Canary deployments



üîµ 2.5 Development environment and PROD environment

1. **Development and QA** most of them in docker and kubernetes
   - we are using eclipse IDE, minikube, docker, postgreSQL(docker), JDK 17, github, gitaction, open telemetry, jeager, graffana, prometheus further we will discuss and finalise 
2. **Production**
   - All AWS based platform and services. But match exact with dev model whereever possible
   - CI/CD from github through gitactions to AWS deployment.
